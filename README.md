# Data Structure and Algorithm

This repo is created as a record of notes and exercises I have completed for studying Data Structure and Algorithm. I use the following resources together and they complement each other during my study.

Resources:

- [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structure and Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Guide-Structures-Algorithms-Second/dp/1680507222/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=a+common+sense+guide+to+data+structures+and+algorithms&qid=1644931994&sprefix=a+common%2Caps%2C91&sr=8-3)
- [Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/)

**UPDATE 02/15/2022**: initial commit.

### Chpt.1 Why Data Structures Matter

**Main concepts**

x. Linear search

### Chpt.2 Why Algorithms Matter

**Main concepts**

1. Algorithm: a set of instructions for completing a specific task.

2. Ordered Array: values should be kept in order \*remain sorted. Slower insertion, much faster search.

3. Linear search vs. Binary search: binary search is only possible within an ordered array.
